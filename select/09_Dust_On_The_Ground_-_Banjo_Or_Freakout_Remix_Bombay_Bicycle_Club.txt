It's that ancient love
That you won't outgrow
It's the fee you pay
It's the debt you owe
It's that subtle way
That you throw me down
And i'm inches above
The dust on the ground

I await your call
I await your crown
Let's change our roads
And chase them all around
It's a subtle way
That you throw me down
And i'm inches above
The dust on the ground

And all is quiet
All is quiet now
And all is silent
All is silent now
No i don't hide it
I don't hide it now

It's that ancient love
That just moves along
There's an itch so slight
Even when you're gone
Well i met you right
But i kept you wrong
And i must wait until i've found the ground
That you are walking on

And all is quiet
All is quiet now
And all is silent
All is silent now
No i don't hide it
I don't hide it now
No i don't hide it
I don't hide it now
