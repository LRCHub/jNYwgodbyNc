It's that ancient love, that you won't outgrow
It's the fee you pay, it's the debt you owe
It's that subtle way, that you throw me down
I am inches above, the dust on the ground

It's that ancient love, that you won't outgrow
It's the fee you pay, it's the debt you owe
It's that subtle way, that you throw me down
I am inches above, the dust on the ground

All is silent, all is silent now
All is quiet, all is quiet now
I don't hide it
I don't hide it, now
I don't hide it
I don't hide it, now
